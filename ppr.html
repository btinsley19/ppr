        <h4>The Post-Work Accord</h4>
        <p><strong>Ratified:</strong> 2057</p>
        <p><strong>Era:</strong> 2040–2075</p>
        <p><strong>Preceded by:</strong> Automation Crisis</p>

      <section id="overview">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p><em>Post-Labor World Development</em> refers to the global transformation between 2025 and 2075 that led to the rise of post-work societies, emotionally-centered professions, and human-AI cohabitation. The turning point was the <strong>Post-Work Accord</strong> in 2057, which ensured equitable life beyond traditional labor.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="displacement">
        <h2>Job Displacement & Inequality</h2>
        <p>By 2028, over 40% of global jobs had been displaced by AI agents. <a href="#">See also: New Great Depression (2029)</a>. A new tech conglomerate, <strong>Syntheso Corp</strong>, emerged as the dominant controller of AI agents, acquiring multiple platforms and systems. As automation surged, wealth inequality reached record highs.</p>
        <p>Following a class action lawsuit in 2031, Syntheso was mandated to allocate a percentage of its cost savings toward public infrastructure and to open a fixed number of "human-only" jobs annually. These included roles such as: X, Y, Z, A, B, C (to be filled in).</p>
        <p>Though the <strong>Universal Basic Income Act</strong> was introduced in 2035, it narrowly failed to pass. Economic tensions grew across the globe.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="resistance">
        <h2>Protests & Resistance</h2>
        <p>Discontent erupted. Widespread protests and digital worker unionization began. AI executives faced public backlash; several were targeted in high-profile acts of vandalism and cyber-activism. In 2038, a pivotal speech by activist <strong>Janae Torres</strong> titled <a href="#">"We Are More Than Code"</a> galvanized global support for humane tech reform.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="reform">
        <h2>Legislation & Education Reform</h2>
        <p>Governments began implementing trade-style education systems, allowing citizens to pursue paths of creativity, care, and craftsmanship. New human-centered jobs and co-creative AI partnerships flourished. National happiness indices began to rise for the first time in decades, accompanied by a surge in interest in nature, community rituals, and spiritual practices.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="ubi">
        <h2>Universal Basic Income Era</h2>
        <p>In 2045, after mounting public demand, the <strong>Universal Basic Income Act</strong> was finally passed. Citizens were guaranteed a baseline income, with the option to work for additional earnings. Many redirected their energy toward hobbies, life-long learning, travel, and care work, creating an era of renewed human purpose and joy.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="meaning">
        <h2>The Meaning Era (2058–2075)</h2>
        <p>New professions emerged: <em>Mythweavers, Soul Technicians, Emotional DJs</em>. Society shifted from productivity to presence. Children were taught philosophy and empathy as core curriculum subjects. Spiritual communities flourished, and shared experience became a cultural cornerstone.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="alternate">
        <h2>Alternate Futures</h2>
        <p>Had key legislation failed, humanity might have descended into civil unrest, resource hoarding, and emotional detachment. One critical moment: the near collapse of the Alignment Bill in 2038. Analysts speculate that without the Torres Speech, the world may have veered toward a techno-authoritarian dystopia.</p>
