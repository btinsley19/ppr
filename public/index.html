        <p><strong>Ratified:</strong> 2073</p>
        <p><strong>Era:</strong> 2040–2075</p>

      <section id="overview">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p><em>Post-Labor World Development</em> refers to the global transformation between 2025 and 2075 that led to the rise of post-work societies, emotionally-centered professions, and human-AI cohabitation.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="displacement">
        <h2>Job Displacement & Inequality (2025 - 2030)</h2>
        <p>By 2030, over 40% of global jobs had been displaced by AI agents resulting in the <a href="#">New Great Depression (2029)</a>. A new tech conglomerate, <a href="#">Syntheso Corp</a> emerged as the dominant controller of AI agents, acquiring multiple platforms and systems. As automation surged, wealth inequality reached record highs.</p>
        </section>

      <section id="resistance">
        <h2>Protests & Resistance (2035 - 2040)</h2>
        <p>Discontent erupted. Widespread protests and digital worker unionization began. AI executives faced <a href="#">public backlash</a> and several were targeted in high-profile acts of vandalism and cyber-activism. In 2038, a pivotal speech by activist <strong>Janae Torres</strong> titled <a href="#">"We Are More Than Code"</a> galvanized global support for humane tech reform.</p>
        <p>Following a <a href="#"> class action lawsuit in 2031</a>, Syntheso was mandated to allocate a percentage of its cost savings toward public infrastructure and to open a fixed number of "human-only" jobs annually. These included roles such as: Narrative Steward, Memory Keeper, Digital Kinship Coordinator, and Human Experience Architect</p>
        <p>Though the <a href="#">Universal Basic Income Act</a> was introduced in 2035, it narrowly failed to pass. Economic tensions grew across the globe.</p>

      <section id="reform">
        <h2>Legislation & Reform (2040 - 2050)</h2>
        <p>Governments began implementing <a href="#">trade-style education systems</a>, allowing citizens to pursue paths of creativity, care, and craftsmanship. New human-centered jobs and co-creative AI partnerships flourished. National happiness indices began to rise for the first time in decades, accompanied by a surge in interest in nature, community rituals, and spiritual practices.</p>
        <p>In this time period, we saw a drastic increase in the quality of life as people were now able to find work to fill their time. Company <a href="optin.html">OptIn</a> became the main marketplace for finding new jobs.</p>
        <p>New technologies like the "AI Companion" created by <a href="#">Holo</a> allowed people to navigate the world in a purposeful and intentionally crafted way.</p>
        <p>A series of legistlation resulted in mandates for cities to have <a href="#">AI-free sanctuaries</a> where humans interacted without the presence of technology.</p>
        <p>One notable AI-free Sanctuary in California called <a href="#">Kinvale Commons</a> became well known for its employment of solely human workers, prompting spin-off communities around the country for those seeking a distinctly human experience.
        <p>In these AI santuaries, humans do jobs that are automated elsewhere, such as bartenderss and cooks.</p>

      <section id="ubi">
        <h2>Universal Basic Income Era (2050 - )</h2>
        <p>In 2045, after mounting public demand, the <a href="#">Universal Basic Income Act</a> was finally passed. Citizens were guaranteed a baseline income, with the option to work for additional earnings. Many redirected their energy toward hobbies, life-long learning, travel, and care work, creating an era of renewed human purpose and joy.</p>
        <p>We saw a rise in the demand for live entertainment and authentic human interaction. Competitive sports became much more common at a young age and they were taken more seriously.</p>
        <p><a href="#">The Robot Combat League (RCA)</a> gained traction initially, but fizzled out as people preferred human sports like the <a href="#">UFC</a> and professional pickleball.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="meaning">
        <h2>The Meaning Era (2054–)</h2>
        <p>Happiness indices continued to skyrocket as people found purpose in their daily lives, living a balance of relaxation, productivity, and kinship.</p>
        <p>New professions emerged: <em>Mythweavers, Soul Technicians, Emotional DJs</em>. Society shifted from productivity to presence. Children were taught philosophy and empathy as core curriculum subjects. <a href="#">Spiritual communities</a> flourished, and shared experience became a cultural cornerstone.</p>
